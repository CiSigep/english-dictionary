# english-dictionary
A console Python App that loads a dictionary for the user to look up english words. First project from Ardit Sulce's Python Mega Course.

## User Interaction
1. User enters a word they would like the definition of.
2. App will respond with the definition of the word they entered.
  * If there isn't an exact match but a close one, the app will ask if the close match is what they're searching for.
  * If there are no matches or close matches the app will say the word was not found in the dictionary.
